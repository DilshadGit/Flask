 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off

Solution:
flask --help
export FLASK_ENV=development 
export FLASK_APP=main.py

to run the server:
python main.py or
flask run

# install wtf to create registration form
pip install flask-wtf to create form fields

To import fields type in the forms
    StringField,

Install sqllite for development and postgress for development to connect need to install flask-sqlalchemy
pip install flask-sqlalchemy

utcnow use for the default when the date are put to the database

lazy will used when the SQLAlchemy load the data from the database and True means on when load display the 
data as it loaded in one go

Process database you need to go to python shell from project enviroment and import from main file the db
to create database run:
db.create_all()

>>> from main import db
